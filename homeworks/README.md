# Homeworks

In this directory you can see some of the homeworks from the course (and my solutions).

Homeworks nor numerated, nor have any statements. That is done in order to make cheating harder for future students of the course.

Code partially written by creators of the course (for example, most of the tests), and partially by me - solutions to the tasks. In each homework I will point out what parts are written by me.
